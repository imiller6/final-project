To run my F1 quiz first simply open the program. Then enter the amount of questions you want to be asked. If you ask for too many it will give all the questions that it can. When entering the answers enter only 'a', 'b', 'c', or  'd'. any other character will be considered as a wrong answer. At the end you will be told how many questions you got corrent and how many you got wrong. The percent correct will also be displayed.
